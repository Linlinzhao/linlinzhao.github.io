<p>I did encounter a few stones on my way to adopt <a href="https://tianqi.name/blog/">Tian Qi’s TeXt</a>
for setting up my own GitHub Pages. I had just two basic requirements: 1. support LaTex syntax. 2. simple but functional. I know very few about web design, that is why even a little stone
could cost me half an hour to move it away.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The first thing is about setting up both ruby and node.js environment on my Ubuntu machine.
Installing Ruby and gem went smoothly, therefore setting up Jekyll is easy. But when I tried
to install <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Node.js</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npm</code>, my Ubuntu constantly complained that it could not install the current
 stable version of Node.js, and it installed <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Node 4.2.6</code> instead, which in turn made the latest <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npm</code>
refuse to work with the old <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Node 4.2.6</code>. Many people filed this
 <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/786272/why-does-installing-node-6-x-on-ubuntu-16-04-actually-install-node-4-2-6">problem</a>
  already, but most of them did not work for me.</p>

    <p>The problem is caused by a discontinued ppa application, I need to remove it from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/apt/source.list</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/apt/source.list.d</code>. This is the detailed <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/65911/how-can-i-fix-a-404-error-when-using-a-ppa-or-updating-my-package-lists">solution</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second thing is to make LaTex work in Markdown. <a href="http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/tex.html">MathJax</a> is
the choice but there exists several ways to set up MathJax in <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/extras/">Jekyll</a>, and
some of them just did not work for me. I did not have the time to dig out the reason but just wanted to find a
quick solution. Eventually I made it work with these settings:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Using <a href="https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#math-blocks">kramdown</a> engine for markdown.</li>
      <li>Putting
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML"&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;</code>
in TeXt theme’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_layouts/page.html</code>. Be sure to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https</code>, otherwise the rendering online could fail.</li>
      <li>Then I could write equations in LaTex! For inline equations, the expressions need to be embraced with double dollar sign like this: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$x$$</code>.
For independent lines, the expressions should start from a new line after <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$</code>, and the ending <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$</code> should also stay in a new line.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, that is it. I hope someone could find this post useful.</p>
