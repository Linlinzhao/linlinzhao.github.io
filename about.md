I blog randomly about random things, of which the random process is hard to model :)

## The Yin-Yang logo
>"道生一，一生二，二生三，三生万物"

>Translate: “Tao gave birth to one, one gave birth to two, two gave birth to three, three gave birth to all the myriad things. All the myriad things carry the yin on their backs and hold the yang in their embrace.”

The "Tao" 道 in Chinese philosophy Taoism means the fundamental rules governing the universe. 

The great physicist Bohr spoke of the unity of opposites and contradictions in nature and reformalized Yin-Yang in Latin as "Contraria sunt Complementa". 

## Favorite quotes


> What I cannot create, I do not understand. -- R. Feynman

> You insist that there is something a machine cannot do. If you will tell me precisely what it is that a machine cannot do, then I can always make a machine which will do just that! -- von Neumann

*This was von Neumann's response to an audience's question 'But of course, a mere machine can't really think, can it?' after his talk in Princeton in 1948.*
