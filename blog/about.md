Break down things to really simple parts so that I can surely understand them.

My favorite quotes is from Mr. Feynman:
> What I cannot create, I do not understand. 

When it comes to solving problems, my favorite quote is from Mr. von Neumann:
> You insist that there is something a machine cannot do. If you will tell me precisely what it is that a machine cannot do, then I can always make a machine which will do just that!

This was his response to an audience's question 'But of course, a mere machine can't really think, can it?' after his talk in Princeton in 1948.
