Once I heard something like this "The best technology that has even been created is book". Truly, the innate abilities encoded in genes make us human beings survive, but the knowledge and wisdom condensed in books make us thrive. 

This post is a growing list of books in different categories

### Science and research

**Probability: the logic of science** by E.T. Jaynes, 2003

It is raining then there must be cloud in the sky. There is no cloud then it must not be raining. 
And this Aristotle logic told us *"there is cloud"* cannot deduce *"it is raining"*. However, the cloud in the sky makes raining more plausible than a clear sky. 
From the basic logics, Jaynes built up the whole realm of probability theory in a natural and consistent way. This is fantastic! I love it, especially as a Bayesian statistics fan.

**Theory of Games and Economic Behavior** by J. von Neumann and O. Morgenstern, 1953

### Machine Learning

**Patter Recognition and Machine Learning** by C. M. Bishop, 2006

**Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms** by D. Mackay

I've built my passion about Bayesian statistics from Dr. MacKay's doctoral thesis. His writing is always right to the point in a simple and clear way.

**The Elements of Statistics Learning** by T. Hastie, R. Tibshirani and J. Friedman, 2008

### Fun but more inspiring
This is my favorite list!

**Surely you are joking, Mr. Feyman** by E. Hutchings

Funny stories from the great physicist Feyman can encourage and inspire you to think and explore more about things surrounding us. The world is wonderful and beautiful.

**Naked Economics**

**Thinking: Fast and Slow**

### Chinese philosophy and history

**庄子 Zhuang zi** by Zhuang zi, ～300BC

The Taoism philosopher emphasized the freedom of living without restrains from daily lives. Following his teachings brings strong and positive mentalities.

**传习录 Chuan Xi Lu** by 王阳明 Wang Yangming ～1500

"知行合一"

**资治通鉴** by 司马光 Sima Guang
