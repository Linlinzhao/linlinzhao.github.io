I am kind of slow when it comes to understand many concepts, comparing to my colleagues, let alone all the bright researchers I met and had talked to. So I like to break down things to really simple parts so that I can surely understand them.

The first of my favorite quotes is from Mr. Feynman:
> What I cannot create, I do not understand. 

When it comes to solving problems, my favorite quote is from Mr. von Neumann:
> You insist that there is something a machine cannot do. If you will tell me precisely what it is that a machine cannot do, then I can always make a machine which will do just that!

Actually this was his response to an audience's question 'But of course, a mere machine can't really think, can it?' after his talk in Princeton in 1948. 

So hopefully I can describe all the things in this blog to be precise, clear and simple.
